# challengR

An implementation of the Riot Games League of Legends API.

Most functions need a development API key that you can obtain from https://developer.riotgames.com/api/ if you have a 
League of Legends account that is at least level 5. Just declare a variable called myAPIKey with the value of your API 
key as a string at the start of your application to use all functions seamlessly.

```r 
myAPIKey <- "<Your API Key>"
```
